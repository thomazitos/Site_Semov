			Contemporary technological approaches to address limb loss and neuromuscular dysfunction consist of synthetic, mechanical devices which lack an intimate bidirectional interface with nervous tissues. This talk will describe the design and validation of reconstructive surgical models to restore musculotendinous and cutaneous sensory feedback. The talk will further discuss the intricacies of the human-machine interface and how we can optimize them to enable seamless communication.

					Shriya is a research affiliate at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and a recent alum of the Media Lab Biomechatronics research group. She graduated from Case Western Reserve University with a BS in biomedical engineering, with a concentration in biomaterials. 
					<br>
					Shriya is currently working on a proprioceptive, regenerative peripheral neural interface that will ultimately enable patients to control their prosthesis with native neural signals. She is also exploring optogenetic techniques to create novel strategies to accelerate and improve neural regeneration.
